# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## How Insertion Sort Works

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list. At each iteration, it removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs in the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats this process until no input elements remain.

## Implementation

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.
